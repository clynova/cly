# Cly

Cly is a powerful system that integrates a language model to perform actions directly on your operating system through user input. This project aims to demonstrate how AI can enhance productivity by simplifying interactions with your system.

## Features

- Execute operating system commands based on natural language input.
- Open specific files, such as videos, based on user requests.
- Flexible and customizable for different use cases.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Provide a natural language command.
2. **Language Model Processing**: The system interprets the input using a language model.
3. **Action Execution**: Cly translates the interpreted input into operating system actions.

## Example Commands

- "Open the video titled 'Vacation 2023.'"
- "Play the song 'My Favorite Playlist.'"
- "Launch the calculator app."
